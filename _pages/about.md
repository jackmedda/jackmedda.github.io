Hi there! I am a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/homepage.page). My research interests revolve around recommender systems, graph learning, and explainability.
During my PhD I focused on responsible AI (fairness, explainability, robustness) in recommender systems and speaker recognition, with a particular focus on how these technologies can impact end-users.

I received my Ph.D. (summa cum laude) in Mathematics and Computer Science from [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/homepage.page) in 2024. I received my Bachelor's (summa cum laude) and Master's (summa cum laude) degree in Computer Science from [University of Cagliari](https://www.unica.it/unica/en/homepage.page).

My research has been published in top-tier conferences (CIKM, ECIR, SIGIR, RecSys, Interspeech) and journals (TIST, IPM, Pattern Recognition Letters).
